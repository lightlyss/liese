# Liese
Liese is one of Homulilly's familiars, responsible for announcing funerals/executions.

## Usage
This is pure frontend and could probably be served from a CDN.
Magia Record posted this countdown timer to announce an upcoming event.
It's been cleaned up here to run standalone. There's a `target` date in
`main.js` that can be changed to update the deadline. It should run in
most browsers.
